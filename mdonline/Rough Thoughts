Creating MDOnline:

Goal:
Create an app that can run simulations online.

Home page:
1. Run a simulation
2. Read some theory

Need a queuing system.
A page where it shows the list of queued up and completed simulations.

A page to select which system to run it on.

This redirects to a page which tells the app what config you want the simulation to run on. Pass the default parameters in the form.

A backend api that calls the c++ program, with the json file.
This should create a folder with a unique name, and store the json, and the results of the simulation.

A page that shows the results of the simulation.

What all should the results contain?
1st: a playable video showing how the simulation works.

Then generative buttons on analysis of data.

A button to download individual files in raw format.
